# ðŸ“– 3rd Party Apps Integrations

## Streamline your workflow

EleAPI has 55+ Integration to automate your workflow for you. EleAPI integration capabilities allow you to seamlessly transfer your lead, appointments, ticket, and task data to the 3rd party apps. You can integrate 3rd party apps with EleAPI in two ways.

1. Use available Native integrations
2. Have the APIs ready! Create your custom integration with EleAPI `My Integration` capabilities.

## Why EleAPI Integrations?

EleAPI bots work as a front-end app for your end customers, and it collects data in the form of the customer chat and other necessary data such as on which page they were, their indicative location (fetched from IP address), device, browser, etc. All this data is available on the EleAPI dashboard. However, You may need the same data in any of the other apps that you might be using, such as

1. CRMs
2. Scheduling software
3. Task/ticket management tools etc

**EleAPI integrations enable you to use these integrations to send the metadata to your apps.**
