<summary>How and when your conversation limits in WhatsApp will increase?</summary>

Each time you initiate a new conversation with a unique customer Meta will determine if your limit should be increased. This determination is based on the following criteria:

* your phone number status is **Connected**
* your phone number quality rating is **Medium** or **High**
* in the last 7 days, you have initiated X or more conversations with unique customers, where X is your current messaging limit divided by 2

If you meet all conditions, we will increase your messaging limit by one level in 24 hours.

<summary>What is the phone number quality rating, and how does it affect my messaging limit?</summary>

The phone number quality rating is a measure of your phone number's reliability and trustworthiness when initiating conversations with customers. If your phone number has been flagged in the last 7 days, Meta will immediately decrease your messaging limit by one level. This means you will have a reduced capacity to initiate new conversations with unique customers.
