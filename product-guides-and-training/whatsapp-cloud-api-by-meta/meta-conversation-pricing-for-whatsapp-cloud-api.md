## Know More about some key concepts

### **Conversation Categories**

Conversations are categorized into the following types:

1. **Marketing**: Includes promotional messages, offers, informational updates, or invitations for customer responses.
2. **Utility**: Facilitates specific, agreed-upon requests or transactions, or provides updates on ongoing transactions.
3. **Authentication**: Enables user authentication with one-time passcodes for account verification, recovery, etc.
4. **Service**: Helps resolve customer inquiries and support-related matters.

{% hint style="info" %}
Please Note: Marketing, utility, and authentication conversations require template messages, while service messages use free-form messages.
{% endhint %}

### **Opening Conversations**

Conversations are opened when you send a template message or free-form message based on the following conditions:

1. **Marketing, Utility, and Authentication Conversations**: When you send an approved template message and no existing open conversation of that category exists with the customer.
2. **Service Conversations**: When you send a free-form message within the customer service window, and no open conversation with any category exists with the customer.

### **Customer Service Windows**

When a customer messages you, a 24-hour customer service window starts. Within this window, you can send free-form and template messages. Outside this window, you can only send template messages.

### **Conversation Duration**

Marketing, utility, authentication, and service conversations last 24 hours unless replaced by a newly opened free-entry point conversation. Free-entry point conversations last 72 hours.

### **Multiple Conversations**

Multiple open conversations are possible with a customer in the following situations:

1. Sending different template messages of various categories within 24 hours.
2. Sending a template message within 24 hours when an open service conversation exists.

### **Free Tier Conversations**

Each WhatsApp Business Account gets 1,000 free service conversations each month across all business phone numbers. Marketing, utility, and authentication conversations are not part of the free tier.

### **Free Entry Point Conversations**

A free entry point conversation opens when a customer messages via a Click to WhatsApp Ad or Facebook Page Call-to-Action button, and you respond within 24 hours. It lasts 72 hours and automatically closes all other open conversations with the customer.
