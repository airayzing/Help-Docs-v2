## What is an external API?

An external API (Application Programming Interface) refers to a set of rules and protocols that allow one software application to interact and communicate with another external software system, service, or platform. It enables different software programs to access and exchange data and functionalities seamlessly, even if they are developed by different organizations or run on different servers.

## Types of APIs

There are several types of APIs, each serving specific purposes and use cases.
