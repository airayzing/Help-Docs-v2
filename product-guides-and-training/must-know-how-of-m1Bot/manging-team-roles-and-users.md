## User & Roles

Here are brief definitions of users and Roles.

<<<<<<<< HEAD:product-guides-and-training/must-know-how-of-m1Bot/manging-team-roles-and-users.md
**Team Users** are client team members with assigned roles and permissions within the platform. These roles define what actions they can perform and what they can access, such as configuring chatbots, managing content, or viewing analytics. Team Users in m1bot help streamline collaboration and access control in the chatbot building and management process.
