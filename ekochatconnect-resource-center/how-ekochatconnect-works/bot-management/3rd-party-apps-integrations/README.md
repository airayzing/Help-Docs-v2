## Why EkoChat Connect Integrations?

EkoChat Connect bots work as a front-end app for your end customers, and it collects data in the form of the customer chat and other necessary data such as on which page they were, their indicative location (fetched from IP address), device, browser, etc. All this data is available on the EkoChat Connect dashboard. However, You may need the same data in any of the other apps that you might be using, such as

1. CRMs
2. Scheduling software
3. Task/ticket management tools etc

**EkoChat Connect integrations enable you to use these integrations to send the metadata to your apps.**
