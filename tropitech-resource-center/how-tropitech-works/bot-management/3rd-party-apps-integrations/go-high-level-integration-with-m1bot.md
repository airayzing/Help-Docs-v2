## Pre-requisite

Before setting up this integration, ensure you have:

* API Token from Go High Level

## Steps to Enable the Integration

1. **Get Required 3rd Party Data:**
   * Obtain the necessary API Token from Go High Level. For assistance, refer to their documentation [here](https://pipedrive.readme.io/docs/how-to-find-the-api-token).
2. **Authenticate Your Account:**
   * Enter the required API Token obtained from Go High Level.
   * Proceed to authenticate your account credentials.
3. **Mapping the Variables:**
   * Once authenticated, you'll see a screen where you can map the chatbot’s answers to the fields of your Go High Level CRM.
   * Select the bot questions from the "Question" dropdown or type "/" to list all questions.
   * Map these questions to parameters in your Go High Level CRM. If dropdowns are not available, enter the parameter names manually.
   * Add new variables as needed by clicking the "Add Parameter" button.
   * Click “Save” to activate your integration.
4. **Test Your Integration:**
   * Open your bot and create a new lead to test the integration. Ensure that the lead is not created earlier.

2. Click on the 3rd party integrations and select the target integration (Go High Level).
3. Click on the “Disconnect” button to disconnect.

## Notes

* To test leads, create the chat in an incognito tab to avoid cache issues.
