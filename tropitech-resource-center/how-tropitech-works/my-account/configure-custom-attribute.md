# ðŸ“– Configure Custom Attribute

## Custom Attributes

Custom Attributes in tropitech are user-defined properties or variables that can be assigned to individual users within your chatbot platform. These attributes enable you to capture and store specific information about users, which they share during chat or can be accessed from external databases. Custom Attributes are a powerful tool for personalizing interactions and creating tailored experiences for users in your chatbot.

## Types of Custom Attributes

There are primarily two types of custom Attributes

1. Custom Attributes whose values are being defined by the answers given by users in the chat flow.
2. Custom Attributes whose values are being defined using the external API for any user.

## Primary Usage

Custom Attributes can be used for the following use cases

1. Personalize user interactions
2. Collect user data
3. Use in the WhatsApp broadcast campaigns
4. Enhance marketing, support, and engagement
5. Use of external APIs in chat flow
6. Export chat data that is not being exported by default
